# AuditTrailAPI
How to Use/Test:
Run the API: dotnet run

Access Swagger UI: Typically at https://localhost:XXXXX/swagger/index.html

Perform CRUD Operations on Products:

POST: Create a new product. Check the Audit endpoint afterwards.

PUT: Update an existing product. Observe the OldValues, NewValues, and ChangedColumns in the audit log.

DELETE: Delete a product. See the "Delete" audit entry.

Query Audit Logs:

GET /api/Audit: Get all audit logs.

GET /api/Audit/Product/{productId}: Get audit logs for a specific product.

Further Enhancements and Considerations:
Asynchronous Operations: Ensure all database operations in your DbContext override are asynchronous to avoid blocking. (Already done for SaveChangesAsync).

Performance: For very high-volume applications, consider using a separate background worker or message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to offload audit logging from the main request thread.

Security: Ensure your audit API endpoints are properly secured with authentication and authorization. Only authorized users should be able to view audit logs.

Error Handling: Add robust error handling to your DbContext and controllers.

Custom Attributes: You could use custom attributes on your models or properties to exclude certain properties from auditing, or to specify friendly names for properties in the audit log.

Generic Audit Trailing: The current implementation assumes a single primary key named "Id". For more complex scenarios (composite keys, different primary key names), you'll need more sophisticated logic to retrieve the EntityId.

Soft Deletes: If you use soft deletes instead of hard deletes, your audit logic in SaveChangesAsync would need to adjust to track an "IsDeleted" flag change as an "Update" rather than a "Delete" operation on the Product entity itself.

Readability of JSON: For very large objects, the JSON strings in OldValues and NewValues can become unwieldy. Consider a separate UI or tool to parse and display these.

Configuration: Make the connection string and any other audit-related settings configurable.

Unit Testing: Thoroughly unit test your ApplicationDbContext's SaveChangesAsync override to ensure correct audit logging behavior for various scenarios (create, update, delete, no changes).

Type Conversion: When storing EntityId, it's currently stored as a string. If your primary keys are GUIDs or integers, ensure consistent type handling when querying.

More Granular User Information: Instead of just ChangedBy (username), you might want to store the UserId (GUID) and link it to a separate Users table for more detailed user information.

This comprehensive guide provides a solid foundation for building a robust audit trail system in your .NET Core Web API. Remember to adapt it to your specific application's needs and security requirements.
